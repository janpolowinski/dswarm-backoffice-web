[![Build Status](https://www.slub-dresden.de/typo3temp/tx_slubbuildstatus/d%253Aswarm%2BBackoffice.svg)](https://www.slub-dresden.de/buildstatus/)[ ![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/dswarm/dswarm](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dswarm/dswarm?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is the backoffice web application of the [d:swarm](http://dswarm.org) data management platform. It gives the user the ability to configure how the [d:swarm backend](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm) is working. At this point you will be able to define mappings between input data and the central data store. A lot more functionality will be implemented along the way.

A detailed documentation can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/dswarm/dswarm-documentation/wiki).

If you just want to develop the backoffice web application have a look at our [Start Development Guide](yo/doc/dev.md).
